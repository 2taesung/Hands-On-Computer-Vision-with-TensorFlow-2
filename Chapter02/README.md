# Chapter 2 - Introduction to TensorFlow

This chapter contains four ways of implementing a simple MNIST model, each with their corresponding Notebooks:

- [MNIST with Keras](mnist_keras.ipynb)
- [MNIST with TensorFlow's mid-level APIs](mnist_tensorflow.ipynb)
- [MNIST with TensorFlow's low-level APIs](mnist_tensorflow_nn.ipynb)
- [MNIST with TensorFlow's Estimator APIs](mnist_estimator.ipynb)
